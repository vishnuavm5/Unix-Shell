The Umix shell commands to get started with

$ whoami
returns the system name

$ ls
returns the list of items in the current directory

$ pwd 

returns the directory in which you are in ( working directory)

The root directory is reffered as /

ls lists out the items in the current directory .
We can specify -F so that the items are categorizes

/ indicates directory
@ indicates link
. indicates executable


If we want to know more about a command what else it can do we can find it out by using any of the below two steps

command --help 

or 

man command  --> man refers to manual

The man command makes the entire terminal in to a page. There are separate navigation tools here to explore this page

up / down arrow to move up and down 
b/ space bar to skip through the pages
/ followed by caharater to search 
if the search returns multiple outputs N to move forward for next search result and shift + N for backward

q to quit the page

We can use the properties of the command at the same time  such as 

ls -F -l

it will return both categories

we can use the combined properties to filter out the results in desired way
-r is  to reverse the list in alphabetaical order and -t ois list the items with respsct its change time

-F property with an arguement can be used to list out specific directory
ls -F directory_name

We can also list out directories in side the parent directory using /

ls -F parent_dir/dir

$cd is used to change the directory 
$cd dir_name changes to the directory to which we want to navigate
$ cd .. moves up  to the directory  as the cd with dir_name can only locate the sub directories
$ cd - it goes to the previous directory

There is significat difference between - and .. 
- navigates to previous directory and .. navigates upper directory in the file system

$ls -F -a will show the directories starts with . ..  a -> actually means show all

Note : $ ls -F -a is equivalent to $ls -Fa

General syntax of shell command 

$ ls -F /
$- prompt
ls- command
-F - option
/ -argument

The linux helps us with tab completion where if you want to use cd with dir_name . You can type cd and tab to get the things autocompleted

$ clear is used to clear the terminal screen
 $ cd is the command to get back to your home directory
